1. Prepare Your Project

Make sure your React or Vue project is ready and builds successfully:

# React (Create React App)
npm run build

# Vue (Vue CLI or Vite)
npm run build
2. Deploy with Netlify
Step-by-step:

Go to netlify.com
 and sign up or log in.

Click New site from Git.

Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository.

Configure the build settings:

Build command:

React: npm run build

Vue: npm run build

Publish directory:

React: build

Vue: dist

Click Deploy Site.

Once deployed, Netlify provides a URL like https://your-site.netlify.app.

3. Deploy with Vercel
Step-by-step:

Go to vercel.com
 and sign up or log in.

Click New Project and import your Git repository.

Vercel automatically detects React or Vue.

Confirm build settings:

Build command:

React: npm run build

Vue: npm run build

Output directory:

React: build

Vue: dist

Click Deploy.

Vercel provides a URL like https://your-project.vercel.app.

4. Manual Deploy (ZIP Upload on Netlify)

Zip your build folder (build or dist).

In Netlify, click Deploy site > Deploy manually and upload the zip.

5. Continuous Deployment

Both platforms auto-deploy when you push commits to your Git repo â€” automatic CI/CD!

6. Bonus Tips

Add a netlify.toml or vercel.json file for custom configurations.

Set environment variables securely in their dashboards.

Use custom domains with SSL (free!).
